# DBD-Settings
Python script for changing Dead By Daylight settings.

This script will change your Engine.ini and GameUserSettings.ini files. The Engine file is fully automatic and will disable mouse smoothing and mouse acceleration. It will also set your max frame rate to 144 instead of the game's default 60.
The next window that appears will allow you to manually change any of the settings inside of the game user settings file. Once you change them to your liking hit save and close the window.
This will also create a backup of the default settings so if you mess anything up you can always click the revert to default settings button when editing the game user settings file to go back to where you started.
